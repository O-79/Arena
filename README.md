<em>Author: Adi</em><br/>

A highly **skill-based, 1v1, peer-to-peer connection** first person shooter (FPS) game.

### Features:

* No recoil
* Custom b(unny)-hop movement (CS:GO-like, but better)
* Instant respawns
* Endless

### How to Play:

0. Download ZIP and extract (do not move Arena.exe out of the folder)
1. Download (and create accounts for) LogMeIn Hamachi on both desired computers
2. Create a private network on one of the computers (host)
3. Join the private network on the other computer (client)
4. Run Arena.exe on the host and click [Host] (*)
5. Run Arena.exe on the client
6. Copy and paste the Hamachi IPv4 address of the host into the [IP Text Field] (*) on the client

(*) Note: for now, use the Network Manager HUD instead of the main menu elements.
